# Castle Defense Game in Pygame

## Overview
This project is a Python port of a strategic computer game originally developed in Lazarus with Pascal during my high school years. The game, titled "Одбраната на замокот" (The Defense of the Castle), challenges players to defend a castle from ghosts attacking from all sides. This README documents the process of recreating the game in Python using the Pygame library, transitioning from the original Lazarus IDE and Pascal programming language to a more modern, open-source environment.

## Game Description
In "The Defense of the Castle", players must protect the castle from invading ghosts by shooting arrows in four directions: north, east, south, and west. The game offers two difficulty levels, normal and "too hard", with the latter focusing more on scoring points as ghosts become nearly indestructible. Gameplay is inspired by old Nintendo games and "Minecraft", featuring pixel art graphics and retro design elements.

## Features
- Strategic gameplay with a focus on defense mechanics
- Two difficulty settings to accommodate different player skills
- Retro, pixel art graphics inspired by classic games
- Upgradeable player attributes including arrow damage, speed, and quantity

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed on your system.
   - Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - Pygame: Run `pip install pygame` in your command line or terminal.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory.

## How to Play
1. Start the game by running `python main.py` from your terminal or command line.
2. Use the W, A, S, D keys to aim in the respective direction (north, west, south, east).
3. Press the space bar to shoot an arrow in the selected direction.
4. Defend the castle from ghosts and try to achieve the highest score possible.
5. Upgrade your capabilities using the points earned from defeating ghosts.

## Development
This game was ported from Pascal to Python as part of a course project in "Video Games Programming and Special Effects". The porting process involved recreating the game mechanics, graphics, and controls using Pygame, a popular Python library for game development.
